# MSc-AI at University of Aberdeen
In this repository, I will post my experience of the [MSc in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/degree-programmes/1034/artificial-intelligence/) program at University of Aberdeen. I hope you find this useful if you are considering to undertake this course.

My main motivation to join the couse was to complement current engineering practices with AI.

## About the University
The computing science department of University of Aberdeen is consistently ranked in [top 5](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/degree-programmes/527/G400/computing-science/#:~:text=Aberdeen%20is%20ranked%202nd%20in,Times%20Good%20University%20Guide%202021.) in UK. The university has very good computing labs and flexible degree programmes. 

In my opinion, the most amazing thing about the university MSc AI course is the interaction with the faculty. They are very approachable, helpful and so enthusiastic about your learning.  They will go an extra mile to make things easy for you to understand. You can irritate them with your silly questions during the lectures or ask for advise on topics they are not related to your coursework. They also welcome students who aspire  to add to their learning by getting involved in the university's research projects. 

## Pre-requisites
I recommend that you have some background knowledge of artificial intelligence and machine learning before you start into the course. The modules are intensive and you are expected to hit the ground running the first day. 

[Effective Computation in Physics: Field Guide to Research with Python](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B010ORQ8DG)
If you don't have a good working knowledge of python then I would recommend to start here. AI involves a lot of programming and it is important for you to enjoy coding and problem solving which this book teaches you. The book is for anyone doing any kind of numerical computation work in python and it also teaches good software dev skills. 

[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1292401133) 
This book needs no introduction. This edition covers most of the advances that have appeared during the last decade (and there have been many of them!). Although not a strict pre-requisite for the course, as some of the modules are based on the chapters of the book but, I would recommend to skim through this book as it gives you a holistic overview of what AI is and what it is not. You can also go though the amazing lectures provided freely by University of Berkley [CS188](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html) course

[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1071614177) I have found this is by far the most helpful book on statistical learning. The only downside is that it uses R. This book connects theory and application very well.

[Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning) 
Very good refresher if you need to review your math skills. You would be able to perform machine learning superficially without going into math of it but it is really helps to understand the core logic of the algorithms. 

[Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)
This course will give you excellent practice of [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) and [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org) libraries. These are essential python libraries for data analysis and machine learning. The MSc course will not teach you these libraries but the libraries are essential to complete assignments in an efficient way. You will likely not have time learn them and complete assignments on such a fast track MSc course.

## Course modules
The following modules were based on the coursework for 2019-2021 session.

* CS551G	Data Mining and Visualization 
* CS5063	Evaluation of AI Systems
* CS551J	Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
* CS5062	Machine Learning
* CS551H	Natural Language Generation
* CS5079	Applied Artificial Intelligence
* CS5060	Foundations of AI
* CS551H	Natural Language Generation
* CS551K	Software Agents And Multi-Agent Systems
* CS5917	MSc Project In Artificial Intelligence

The [MSc Project](./MSc%20Project/thesis.pdf) was on using active machine learning for optimising engineering simulations.

## Big takeaway
The easiest way to master anything is applying it. Find a problem you are sufficiently interested in solving with AI. Learn everything about the problem and then go explore what tools are available in the world to solve your problem. Keep improvising until you are satisfied with the solution. Motivation (from yourself) and good advice (from professors/colleagues with experience) is all you need.
